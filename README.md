Machine Learning App with Streamlit
<!-- Add a screenshot of your app -->

Overview
This project is a web application built using Streamlit that allows users to upload a dataset, preprocess it, train a machine learning model, and evaluate the model's performance. It is designed to be user-friendly and accessible, even to those with limited experience in machine learning.

Features
Data Upload: Users can upload CSV files.
Data Preprocessing: Automatic handling of missing values and encoding of categorical variables.
Model Training: Train a logistic regression model on the uploaded dataset.
Model Evaluation: Display accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
Interactive Interface: Easy-to-use interface built with Streamlit.
Getting Started
Prerequisites
Python 3.7 or higher
pip (Python package installer)
Installation
